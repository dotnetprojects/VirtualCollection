VirtualCollection
=================

A sample that demonstrates how to implement Data Virtualization (or Stealth Paging) for Silverlight (could also be adapted for WPF). Includes a VirtualizingWrapPanel.

Original project from:

http://blog.functionalfun.net/2012/08/data-virtualization-in-silverlight.html

but I changed a lot of things so that it works with both, SL5 and WPF and Interlinq over WCF!
